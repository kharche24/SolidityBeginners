## Burning and Minting token.
This is a basic Solidity smart contract . 

## DESCIRPTION
This Solidity smart contract contains several features to manage a custom token. It includes two public variables: one for the token's name and another for its abbreviation. The contract also has a variable that keeps track of the total token supply. To manage user balances, there is a mapping variable named "balances" that connects addresses with their corresponding token balances.
The contract provides two essential functions: "mint" and "burn." The "mint" function allows the contract owner to increase the balance of a specific address by a given amount of tokens. On the other hand, the "burn" function allows the contract owner to decrease the balance of a specified address by a certain number of tokens, but only if the address has a sufficient balance to accommodate the requested reduction. In essence, these functions enable the contract owner to create new tokens (mint) and destroy existing tokens (burn) for specific addresses in the system.

## COMPILER 
Use remixIDE 

## EXECUTING THE PROGRAM
* Create a new folder 
* If Remix is set to auto compile and run, the code will be automatically compiled and executed. Otherwise, manually compile and run the code by selecting the "Compile and Run" option from the left menu.
* After compiling, deploy the contract to get the account address for next steps.
* The contract gets deployed successfully.
* Initially, the account balance is zero.
* To mint tokens, click on the "Mint" button, paste the account address, enter the desired token quantity (e.g., 700), and click "Transact" to add tokens to the account.
* To check the balance, click on "Balances," paste the account address, and click "Call" to view the account balance.
* To burn tokens, click on "Burn," paste the account address, set the value to be burnt (e.g., 500), and click "Transact" to reduce tokens from the account.
* To check the balance again, press "Call" to obtain the latest balance (e.g., 700-500 = 200 tokens).
* These are all the steps involved in the contract.
